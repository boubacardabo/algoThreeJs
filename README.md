# algoThreeJs v1

Use cases of popular algorithms and rendered in three.js in React Native App and served with TypeScript NodeJs

# Project Structure

## Front:

Components used for examples are rendered with three.js. The user has hte ability to set initial parameters and launch simulation.

> _Technologies used: TypeScript, React, React Native, ThreeJs_

## Back:

The back receives request and executes algorithms with initial parameters and outputs sets of moves or actions that acts as input for the simulation that renders accordingly

> _Technologies used: NodeJs, express.js, TypeScript_

## Action sets:

Choose the most efficient way to encode sets of moves/actions for simulations
